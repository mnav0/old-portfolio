To achieve this goal, I researched responsive design and how I could use the fact that this site would primarily be viewed on mobile for the first time to guide the design choices I made while creating the desktop version, sticking to minimal elements that could be stacked and easily viewed on mobile. I also kept this in mind while developing the site, sizing every component relative to the browser width."]} maxW={'50%'}/>
